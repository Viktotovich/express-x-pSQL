# Why?

Convention over configuration.

This template is for my personal use,
but everyone is welcome to use it. 

It has no warrantees / gurantees and it may lack feautures.

I will try to add as many necessary packages as possible,
i.e: Passport JS (with time) - and make it as easy
as possible to spring up an Express app. 

However, this shouldn't be extensively relied on, as it's meant to:

1. Serve as a reminder of what packages are absolutely necessary.

2. Have small bits of code that demonstrate / remind myself of it's usage.

3. Serve as a mini documentation || collection of the most important resources.

I work with many technologies: including (but not limited to): React, React Router, Astro, EJS, Webpack, Express, Vite, Node;
They all have different ways of working with things, even in routing.

For example, routing in Astro or Next JS is *drastically* different than routing in Node, Express, or React Router.

Henceforth, I find it easy to be caught in a "syntax web". 

This template, is not a silver bullet. But it is damn near to one.
